            "In supervised learning, it can be used for either classification or regression applications. In unsupervised learning, it\u2019s popularly used for anomaly detection; that is, finding data that doesn\u2019t belong and removing it.\nNeural Networks\nNeural network algorithm is a term for a collection of AI algorithms that mimic the functions of a human brain. These tend to be more complex than many of the algorithms discussed above and have applications beyond some of the ones discussed here. In unsupervised and supervised learning, it can be used for classification and pattern recognition.\nReinforcement learning algorithms\nThe last major type of AI algorithm is reinforcement learning algorithms, which learn by taking in feedback from the result of its action. This is typically in the form of a \u201creward.",
            "How do AI algorithms work?\nWhile a general algorithm can be simple, AI algorithms are by nature more complex. AI algorithms work by taking in training data that helps the algorithm to learn. How that data is acquired and is labeled marks the key difference between different types of AI algorithms.\nAt the core level, an AI algorithm takes in training data (labeled or unlabeled, supplied by developers, or acquired by the program itself) and uses that information to learn and grow. Then it completes its tasks, using the training data as a basis. Some types of AI algorithms can be taught to learn on their own and take in new data to change and refine their process. Others will need the intervention of a programmer in order to streamline.\nTypes of artificial intelligence algorithms",
            "K-means is an algorithm designed to perform the clustering function in unsupervised learning. It does this by taking in the pre-determined clusters and plotting out all the data regardless of the cluster. It then plots a randomly-selected piece of data as the centroid for each cluster (think of it as a circle around each cluster, with that piece of data as the exact center point). From there, it sorts the remaining data points into clusters based on their proximity to each other and the centroid data point for each cluster.\nGaussian mixture model\nGaussian mixture models are similar to K-means clustering in many ways. Both are concerned with sorting data into pre-determined clusters based on proximity. However, Gaussian models are a little more versatile in the shapes of the clusters they allow.",
            "Picture a graph with all your data points plotted out. K-means clustering only allows data to be clustered in circles with the centroid in the center of each cluster. Gaussian mixture can handle data that lands on the graph in more linear patterns, allowing for oblong-shaped clusters. This allows for greater clarity in clustering if one datapoint lands inside the circle of another cluster.\nBoth supervised and unsupervised algorithms\nSome AI algorithms can use either supervised or unsupervised data input and still function. They might have slightly different applications based on their status.\nK-nearest neighbor algorithm\nK-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a simplistic AI algorithm that assumes that all the data points provided are in proximity to each other and plots them out on a map to show the relationship between them. Then the algorithm can calculate the distance between data points in order to extrapolate their relationship, and calculate the distance on a graph.",
            "Decision trees classify all the data into decision nodes. It uses a selection criteria called Attribute Selection Measures (ASM) which takes into account various measures (some examples would be entropy, gain ratio, information gain, etc). Using the root data and following the ASM, the decision tree can classify the data it is given by following the training data into sub-nodes until it reaches the conclusion.\nRandom Forest\nThe random forest algorithm is actually a broad collection of different decision trees, leading to its name. The random forest builds different decision trees and connects them to gain more accurate results. These can be used for both classification and regression.\nSupport Vector Machines",
            "A reinforcement algorithm is usually composed of two major parts: an agent that performs an action, and the environment in which the action is performed. The cycle begins when the environment sends a \u201cstate\u201d signal to the agent. That queues the agent to perform a specific action within the environment. Once the action is performed, the environment sends a \u201creward\u201d signal to the agent, informing it on what happened, so the agent can update and evaluate its last action. Then, with that new information, it can take the action again. That cycle repeats until the environment sends a termination signal.\nThere are two types of reinforcement the algorithm can use: either a positive reward, or a negative one.\nDefinitions: Model, Policy, Value\nIn reinforcement algorithms, there are slightly different approaches depending on what is being measured and how it\u2019s being measured. Here are some definitions of different models and measures:",
            "It may at this point be relatively easy to guess what unsupervised learning algorithms mean, in comparison to supervised learning. Unsupervised learning algorithms are given data that isn\u2019t labeled. Unsupervised learning algorithms use that unlabeled data to create models and evaluate the relationships between different data points in order to give more insight to the data.\nDefinition: Clustering\nMany unsupervised learning algorithms perform the function of clustering, which means they sort the unlabeled data points into pre-defined clusters. The goal is to have each data point belong to only one cluster, with no overlap. There can be more than one data point in any given cluster, but a data point cannot belong to more than one cluster.\nK-means clustering",

It uses the labeled data to predict outcomes for other data. The name \u201csupervised learning\u201d comes from the comparison of a student learning in the presence of a teacher or expert.",

That\u2019s why we developed AI analytics, to offer the best predictive analytics to our clients. Learn how Tableau helps customers succeed with AI analytics now.",
            "The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is another common AI algorithm that can be used for either classification or regression (but is most often used for classification). SVM works by plotting each piece of data on a chart (in N dimensional space where N = the number of datapoints). Then, the algorithm classifies the datapoints by finding the hyperplace that separates each class. There can be more than one hyperplane.\nNaive Bayes\nThe reason this algorithm is called \u201cNaive Bayes\u201d is that it\u2019s based on Bayes\u2019 Theorem, and also relies heavily on a large assumption: that the presence of one particular feature is unrelated to the presence of other features in the same class. That major assumption is the \u201cnaive\u201d aspect of the name.\nNaive Bayes is useful for large datasets with many different classes. It, like many other supervised learning algorithms, is a classification algorithm.\nLinear regression",
            "Building a supervised learning algorithm that actually works takes a team of dedicated experts to evaluate and review the results, not to mention data scientists to test the models the algorithm creates to ensure their accuracy against the original data, and catch any errors from the AI.\nDefinitions: Classification and Regression\nBelow, we jump into explaining the different types of supervised learning algorithms. All of them can either be used for classification or regression, or both.\nClassification means an either/or result using binary (0 = no, 1 = yes). So the algorithm will classify something as either one or another, but never both. There is also multi-class classification, which deals with organizing data into defined categories or types relevant to a specific need.",
            "Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science concerned with creating machines that can think and make decisions independently of human intervention. Those AI programs can do complex tasks that were previously only able to be done by humans. Some AI programs can complete simple tasks, some more complex. Some can take in data to learn and improve, completely without the touch of a human developer.\nWhat is an AI algorithm?\nSo then what is an AI algorithm? The definition of an algorithm is \u201ca set of instructions to be followed in calculations or other operations.\u201d This applies to both mathematics and computer science. So, at the essential level, an AI algorithm is the programming that tells the computer how to learn to operate on its own.\nAn AI algorithm is much more complex than what most people learn about in algebra, of course. A complex set of rules drive AI programs, determining their steps and their ability to learn. Without an algorithm, AI wouldn\u2019t exist.",
            "- Policy: The approach the agent takes to determine the next action taken by the agent.\n- Model: The situation and dynamics of the environment.\n- Value: The expected long-term results. This is different from the reward, which is the result of a single action within the environment. The Value is the long-term result of many actions.\nValue-based\nIn a value-based reinforcement algorithm the agent pushes toward an expected long-term return, instead of just focusing on the short-term reward.\nPolicy-based\nA policy-based reinforcement algorithm usually takes one of two approaches to determining the next course of action. Either a standardized approach where any state produces the same action or a dynamic approach where certain probabilities are mapped out and probabilities calculated. Each probability has its own policy reaction.\nModel-based",
            "In this algorithm, the programmer creates a different dynamic for each environment. That way, when the agent is put into each different model, it learns to perform consistently under each condition.\nUses of AI algorithms\nThere are thousands of applications for AI systems and algorithms. We touched on what may seem like simple algorithms in this article, but even those have hundreds of possible applications. The possibilities are endless.\nSome common uses of AI algorithms include:\n- Data entry and classification\n- Advanced or predictive analytics\n- Search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.)\n- Digital assistants (Siri, Alexa, etc.)\n- Robotics (assembly machines, self-driving cars, etc.)\nAI algorithms and business applications",
            "In this age of rapid technological advancement, most people are familiar with AI. We\u2019ve likely all read the articles about automation destroying jobs, or a future of robots taking over the world. While those articles are more based on science fiction than a tangible future of AI, it certainly keeps interest in AI top-of-mind for many people.\nThere are dozens of examples of AI that everyday consumers may use, such as facial recognition, auto-correct, search engines, or social media algorithms. But have you ever wondered how these programs work?\nAI runs off of algorithms, but not all AI algorithms are the same. They\u2019re developed with different goals and methods. In this article, we\u2019ll talk about the four major categories of AI algorithms and how they all work.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll cover:\nWhat is artificial intelligence?",
            "Regression means the result will end with a real number (either round or a decimal point). You usually have a dependent variable and an independent variable, and the algorithm will use both points to estimate a possible other result (either forecast or generalized estimate).\nDecision Tree\nOne of the most common supervised learning algorithms, decision trees get their name because of their tree-like structure (even though the tree is inverted). The \u201croots\u201d of the tree are the training datasets and they lead to specific nodes which denote a test attribute. Nodes often lead to other nodes, and a node that doesn\u2019t lead onward is called a \u201cleaf\u201d.",
            "Linear regression is a supervised learning AI algorithm used for regression modeling. It\u2019s mostly used for discovering the relationship between data points, predictions, and forecasting. Much like SVM, it works by plotting pieces of data on a chart with the X-axis is the independent variable and the Y-axis is the dependent variable. The data points are then plotted out in a linear fashion to determine their relationship and forecast possible future data.\nLogistic regression\nA logistic regression algorithm usually uses a binary value (0/1) to estimate values from a set of independent variables. The output of logistic regression is either 1 or 0, yes or no. An example of this would be a spam filter in email. The filter uses logistic regression to mark whether an incoming email is spam (0) or not (1).\nLogistic regression is only useful when the dependent variable is categorical, either yes or no.\nUnsupervised learning algorithms"

Some of the most commonly cited benefits include:\nAI can automate routine, repetitive and often tedious tasks\u2014including digital tasks such as data collection, entering and preprocessing, and physical tasks such as warehouse stock-picking and manufacturing processes.

In addition, 38 percent of organizations have implemented generative AI into their workflows while 42 percent are considering doing so.\nWith so many changes coming at such a rapid pace, here\u2019s what shifts in AI could mean for various industries and society at large.\nThe Evolution of AI",
            "In response, the Biden-Harris administration developed an AI Bill of Rights that lists data privacy as one of its core principles. Although this legislation doesn\u2019t carry much legal weight, it reflects the growing push to prioritize data privacy and compel AI companies to be more transparent and cautious about how they compile training data.\nIncreased Regulation\nAI could shift the perspective on certain legal questions, depending on how generative AI lawsuits unfold in 2024. For example, the issue of intellectual property has come to the forefront in light of copyright lawsuits filed against OpenAI by writers, musicians and companies like The New York Times. These lawsuits affect how the U.S. legal system interprets what is private and public property, and a loss could spell major setbacks for OpenAI and its competitors.",
            "At the same time, AI could be seen as a key culprit in climate change. The energy and resources required to create and maintain AI models could raise carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent, dealing a devastating blow to any sustainability efforts within tech. Even if AI is applied to climate-conscious technology, the costs of building and training models could leave society in a worse environmental situation than before.\nAccelerated Speed of Innovation",
            "Ethical issues that have surfaced in connection to generative AI have placed more pressure on the U.S. government to take a stronger stance. The Biden-Harris administration has maintained its moderate position with its latest executive order, creating rough guidelines around data privacy, civil liberties, responsible AI and other aspects of AI. However, the government could lean toward stricter regulations, depending on changes in the political climate.\nClimate Change Concerns\nOn a far grander scale, AI is poised to have a major effect on sustainability, climate change and environmental issues.

The technology could be used to provide elderly care and help out in the home. In addition, workers could collaborate with AI in different settings to enhance the efficiency and safety of workplaces.\nIs AI a threat to humanity?\nIt depends on how people in control of AI decide to use the technology. If it falls into the wrong hands, AI could be used to expose people\u2019s personal information, spread misinformation and perpetuate social inequalities, among other malicious use cases.",
            "The reputation of AI has been tainted with a habit of reflecting the biases of the people who train the algorithmic models. For example, facial recognition technology has been known to favor lighter-skinned individuals, discriminating against people of color with darker complexions. If researchers aren\u2019t careful in rooting out these biases early on, AI tools could reinforce these biases in the minds of users and perpetuate social inequalities.\nDeepfakes and Misinformation\nThe spread of deepfakes threatens to blur the lines between fiction and reality, leading the general public to question what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t. And if people are unable to identify deepfakes, the impact of misinformation could be dangerous to individuals and entire countries alike. Deepfakes have been used to promote political propaganda, commit financial fraud and place students in compromising positions, among other use cases.\nData Privacy",
            "Job Disruption\nBusiness automation has naturally led to fears over job losses. In fact, employees believe almost one-third of their tasks could be performed by AI. Although AI has made gains in the workplace, it\u2019s had an unequal impact on different industries and professions. For example, manual jobs like secretaries are at risk of being automated, but the demand for other jobs like machine learning specialists and information security analysts has risen.\nWorkers in more skilled or creative positions are more likely to have their jobs augmented by AI, rather than be replaced. Whether forcing employees to learn new tools or taking over their roles, AI is set to spur upskilling efforts at both the individual and company level."

AI-enabled camera technology can automatically detect anatomical landmarks in a patient to enable fast, accurate and consistent patient positioning. In addition, AI-enabled image reconstruction can help to reduce radiation dose and improve CT image quality, thereby supporting diagnostic confidence.",
            "As healthcare increasingly moves from the hospital into the home and the community, the power of AI doesn\u2019t remain confined to hospital walls. It can also be applied to data that is conveniently collected at home or elsewhere, through medical-grade wearable technology. For example, in cardiac care, cloud-based AI can help with the quick detection of atrial fibrillation or heart rhythm disturbances, based on an analysis of remote electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Atrial fibrillation affects millions of people each year. However, the condition is often unrecognized and untreated. By flagging readings that may require the most urgent attention, clinicians are empowered to deliver cardiac care faster and more efficiently. With AI-assisted analysis, cardiac care could eventually become more predictive and proactive. A recent study underscored this potential, showing how a deep learning model can predict the short-term risk of atrial fibrillation based on 24-hour Holter recordings "

            "Its growing appeal and utility are undeniable. Worldwide business spending on AI is expected to hit $50 billion this year and $110 billion annually by 2024, even after the global economic slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a forecast released in August by technology research firm IDC.

But AI has rapidly grown in sophistication, owing to more powerful computers and the compilation of huge data sets. One branch, machine learning, notable for its ability to sort and analyze massive amounts of data and to learn over time, has transformed countless fields, including education.",
            "Though automation is here to stay, the elimination of entire job categories, like highway toll-takers who were replaced by sensors because of AI\u2019s proliferation, is not likely, according to Fuller.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to see is jobs that require human interaction, empathy, that require applying judgment to what the machine is creating [will] have robustness,\u201d he said.\nWhile big business already has a huge head start, small businesses could also potentially be transformed by AI, says Karen Mills \u201975, M.B.A. \u201977, who ran the U.S. Small Business Administration from 2009 to 2013. With half the country employed by small businesses before the COVID-19 pandemic, that could have major implications for the national economy over the long haul.",
            "Given its power and expected ubiquity, some argue that the use of AI should be tightly regulated. But there\u2019s little consensus on how that should be done and who should make the rules.\nThus far, companies that develop or use AI systems largely self-police, relying on existing laws and market forces, like negative reactions from consumers and shareholders or the demands of highly-prized AI technical talent to keep them in line.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no businessperson on the planet at an enterprise of any size that isn\u2019t concerned about this and trying to reflect on what\u2019s going to be politically, legally, regulatorily, [or] ethically acceptable,\u201d said Fuller.\nFirms already consider their own potential liability from misuse before a product launch, but it\u2019s not realistic to expect companies to anticipate and prevent every possible unintended consequence of their product, he said.\nFew think the federal government is up to the job, or will ever be.",
            "Panic over AI suddenly injecting bias into everyday life en masse is overstated, says Fuller. First, the business world and the workplace, rife with human decision-making, have always been riddled with \u201call sorts\u201d of biases that prevent people from making deals or landing contracts and jobs.\nWhen calibrated carefully and deployed thoughtfully, resume-screening software allows a wider pool of applicants to be considered than could be done otherwise, and should minimize the potential for favoritism that comes with human gatekeepers, Fuller said.\nSandel disagrees. \u201cAI not only replicates human biases, it confers on these biases a kind of scientific credibility. It makes it seem that these predictions and judgments have an objective status,\u201d he said.",
            "But its game-changing promise to do things like improve efficiency, bring down costs, and accelerate research and development has been tempered of late with worries that these complex, opaque systems may do more societal harm than economic good. With virtually no U.S. government oversight, private companies use AI software to make determinations about health and medicine, employment, creditworthiness, and even criminal justice without having to answer for how they\u2019re ensuring that programs aren\u2019t encoded, consciously or unconsciously, with structural biases.",

But at the same time, if you think about the history of technology, there's been lots of technologies that have displaced people from their work.\u201d\nListen to the full Parlor Room episode with Hsieh about ethical AI, or watch it on YouTube.",
            "- Regularly reviewing and updating data practices\nWith the support of your team, you can build trust throughout your organization that data is secure and private.\n5. Inclusiveness\nInclusion is vital in business. Whether it's integrating various groups in decision-making or accepting diverse opinions and ideas in the workplace, inclusion aims to maintain balance.\nYet, with the increasing use of AI, a new kind of inclusion must be addressed.\nAccording to Iansiti, several industries can\u2019t easily leverage AI, and they\u2019re falling behind in today\u2019s economy.\n\u201cThe divide is fundamentally the digital divide,\u201d Iansiti says in AI Essentials for Business. \u201cThat means that anything that's repeated can increasingly be done by an algorithm or a machine. And so those kinds of jobs have stalled, which is one big reason why, for example, manufacturing jobs have been growing more slowly across many economies than non-manufacturing jobs.\u201d",
            "With the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI), many organizations are quickly trying to adapt to and implement new technologies. According to a PwC survey, 73 percent of U.S. companies have already adopted AI in some aspect of their business.\nYet, in the rush to implement AI, some companies ignore the ethical concerns.\n\u201cWe need to go back and think about that a little bit because it's becoming very fundamental to a whole new generation of leaders across both small and large firms,\u201d says Harvard Business School Professor Marco Iansiti, who co-teaches the online course AI Essentials for Business with HBS Professor Karim Lakhani. \u201cThe extent to which, as these firms drive this immense scale, scope, and learning, there are all kinds of really important ethical considerations that need to be part of the management, the leadership philosophy from the get-go.\u201d\nYou must address these issues to remain competitive in the digital age.\nFree E-Book: Your Guide to Online Learning Success",
            "Imagine a news organization using AI to recommend articles to readers. If the AI system frequently suggests certain news stories over others, those articles receive more attention and clicks, which can greatly shape the public\u2019s opinion.\nThis phenomenon raises several ethical concerns about fairness, transparency, and the potential for misinformation.\nIn AI Essentials for Business, Iansiti uses online encyclopedia Wikipedia as an example of how communities can counteract digital amplification. Since the website allows users to post and edit content, opposing sides of an argument can edit one another\u2019s work, getting closer to the truth.\n\u201cIt's a wonderful testament to the power of communities in policing themselves and becoming better over time,\u201d Iansiti says. \u201cEven the individual editors get better. They have less bias measurably over time as they react to more and more of the community that essentially corrects what it\u2019s saying.\u201d",
            "\u201cHow do you inoculate yourself against the changes that are coming? How do you stay relevant? The answer: develop leadership skills,\u201d writes Patrick Mullane, executive director of HBS Online and Executive Education, in Forbes. \u201cLeading others is something generative AI tools can\u2019t do. The intuition, charisma, relationship-building, and other traits common in a great leader don\u2019t exist in generative AI.\u201d\nHowever, a shifting workforce isn\u2019t the only challenge you must address when implementing AI. Here are five ethical concerns of AI in business that can greatly impact your organization\u2019s success in the digital age.\nEthical Considerations of AI in Business\n1. Digital Amplification\nUnderstanding digital amplification is crucial when using AI in your business operations. Digital amplification refers to AI enhancing the reach and influence of digital content.\nThis can involve algorithms:\n- Prioritizing certain information\n- Shaping public opinion\n- Amplifying specific voices",
            "Consider automated teller machines\u2019 (ATMs) impact on bank tellers. While this shift caused an initial disruption in the banking industry, it also made it easier for banks to open additional branches\u2014spurring demand for tellers\u2014and created new roles that required different skills, such as IT support and customer service.\nWhile AI may lead to the displacement of certain jobs, it also paves the way for new roles. According to the World Economic Forum, around 85 million jobs could be displaced by 2025\u2014with 97 million new jobs emerging that require advanced technical competencies and soft skills, such as leadership, creativity, and emotional intelligence.",
            "In the workplace, you can mimic this by encouraging diverse participation in data collection and decision-making, with more open dialogue and regular reviews of AI systems to ensure fairness.\n2. Algorithmic Bias\nAlgorithms are the backbone of AI\u2019s ability to streamline and optimize business operations. Yet, they open your organization to possible bias that can negatively impact you and your employees.\nAlgorithmic bias is the systematic discrimination that can occur when AI decision-making is influenced by prejudiced data, resulting in unfair outcomes like:\n- Discriminatory hiring\n- Unequal access to resources\n- Workplace bias\nImagine if your company used AI to quickly review applicants\u2019 resumes to help identify the most qualified candidates based on specific criteria. It could streamline the recruitment process, allowing your team to focus on interviewing and evaluating the best matches for the role.",
            "Manufacturing isn\u2019t the only industry feeling left out in the digital economy. Brick-and-mortar retail will likely struggle as well. Now that online retailers leverage AI for personalized marketing, efficient inventory management, and enhanced customer experiences, retail stores quickly lose the \u201cpersonal touch\u201d that has kept them alive since the online shopping boom.\nTo address this ethical concern, try fostering a diverse and inclusive environment in both human interactions and technology deployment. Prioritize investing in training and resources for roles that could be left behind due to AI.\nBy proactively addressing these gaps, you can help create a more balanced and equitable workplace, ensuring that all sectors and individuals have the opportunity to thrive in the digital economy.\nBecome an Ethical Leader in AI",
            "Robust cybersecurity measures tailored to AI are essential for protecting data from unauthorized access, misuse, or breaches. Failing to secure data can lead to financial losses and damage to your organization's reputation.\nYour industry often influences how you address cybersecurity. For example, healthcare organizations must comply with strict regulations like HIPAA to protect patient data, requiring robust AI data security measures. In contrast, retail companies need to prioritize protecting customer payment information.\nHowever, there are a few tactics you can use to help with cybersecurity in the age of AI, no matter what industry you\u2019re in.",

            "For example, regularly updating your software and enabling multi-factor authentication are simple yet effective ways to protect your data. In addition, training employees to recognize phishing attempts can significantly reduce the risk of breaches. According to a KnowBe4 report, 86 percent of organizations reduced the threat of phishing attacks after one year of security awareness training.\nSimply paring down waste can also help boost your organization\u2019s cybersecurity.\n\u201cOne thing to be said about all these cybersecurity challenges is that you need to be careful about not keeping data you don't need,\u201d Iansiti says in AI Essentials for Business. \u201cThere are so many times that I've heard from an executive, something like \u2018I have great data. I have so much customer data. I'm not quite sure what I'm doing with it yet, but I'm keeping it just in case I figure it out.\u2019\u201d\nTherefore, you can help avoid catastrophic data breaches by minimizing data storage so protecting it isn\u2019t a huge feat.",
            "However, if the AI system is trained on biased data\u2014such as the notion that men dominate the finance industry or nurses are primarily female\u2014it may unfairly prioritize candidates and overlook qualified ones from diverse backgrounds.\n\u201cWe need to be sure that in a world that's driven by algorithms, the algorithms are actually doing the right things,\u201d Iansiti says in AI Essentials for Business. \u201cThey're doing the legal things. And they're doing the ethical things.\u201d\nTo address algorithmic bias, you must ensure your AI systems are built on diverse data sets. You can start by regularly auditing and testing these systems for biased outcomes. You can also encourage a culture of inclusivity by involving a diverse team in the development and review processes.\nBy taking these steps, you can promote fairness and transparency in your organization's AI applications.\n3. Cybersecurity",
            "Cybersecurity is a major ethical concern for AI-driven firms because these systems often handle sensitive data, making them desirable targets for cyberattacks.\nCybersecurity challenges include:\n- Phishing: An online scam where cybercriminals disguise themselves as a legitimate individual or organization to trick you into revealing personal information or financial data\n- Malware: A combination of \"malicious\" and \"software,\" it's a program used to gain unauthorized access to companies' IT systems to steal data, disrupt services, or take control\n- Ransomware: A type of malware, ransomware prohibits individuals from accessing their data by encrypting their files and demanding a ransom payment to restore them\nSeveral businesses are experiencing an increase in these attacks, with 85 percent of cybersecurity leaders citing that recent attacks are the result of bad actors using AI.",
            "4. Privacy\nEthical concerns around AI privacy focus on collecting, storing, and using employee data. AI systems can analyze vast amounts of personal and professional information, which must be properly protected to avoid privacy violations, unauthorized access, and misuse.\n\u201cWe've got a big privacy problem as our economy becomes increasingly digital,\u201d Iansiti says in AI Essentials for Business. \u201cAnd interestingly, in some ways, the privacy and the cybersecurity problems are becoming increasingly tied together because one of the big challenges with data isn\u2019t necessarily what the company will do on purpose, but what some rogue agents might do as they get in on the company's networks from the outside illegally and start pilfering all kinds of personal data that they might use in all kinds of nefarious ways.\u201d\nTo address these concerns, you need to establish transparent data tactics, including:\n- Communicating data usage policies to employees\n- Implementing strong cybersecurity measures"

The following best practices can help achieve these goals:\n- Appoint an ethics leader. There are instances when many well-intentioned people sit around a table discussing various ethical AI issues but fail to make informed, decisive calls to action, Roselund noted. A single leader appointed by the CEO can drive decisions and actions.\n- Take a cross-functional approach. Implementing AI tools and technologies companywide requires cross-functional cooperation, so the policies and procedures to ensure AI's responsible use need to reflect that approach, Roselund advised. Ethical AI requires leadership, but its success isn't the sole responsibility of one person or department.",
            "- Establish ethical AI measurements. For employees to buy into an ethical AI framework and responsible AI policies, companies need to be transparent about their intentions, expectations and corporate values, as well as their plans to measure success. \"Employees not only need to be made aware of these new ethical emphases, but they also need to be measured in their adjustment and rewarded for adjusting to new expectations,\" explained Brian Green, director of technology ethics at Markkula Center for Applied Ethics.\n- Be open to different opinions.

It also promotes an operational approach for implementing ethics as an ongoing practice, akin to DevSecOps for ethics. The core idea is to bring legal, technical and business teams together during ethical AI's early stages to root out the bugs at a time when they're much cheaper to fix than after responsible AI deployment.",
            "\"Oftentimes, businesses and leaders are narrowly focused on one of these elements when they need to focus on all them,\" Roselund reasoned. Addressing any one element may be a good starting point, but by considering all three elements -- controls, cultural norms and governance -- businesses can devise an all-encompassing ethical AI framework. This approach is especially important when it comes to generative AI and its ability to democratize the use of AI.\nEnterprises must also instill AI ethics into those who develop and use AI tools and technologies. Open communication, educational resources, and enforced guidelines and processes to ensure the proper use of AI, Roselund advised, can further bolster an internal AI ethics framework that addresses generative AI.\nThis article is part of\nWhat is enterprise AI?

And work is currently being done to fully automate detecting and locating brain segments that need to be removed during epilepsy surgery.\nRight now, Dr. Jehi is focusing on understanding how a patient\u2019s genetic composition and brain plays into their epilepsy. How do they respond to epilepsy based on a number of factors? How do they respond to epilepsy surgery? And are these factors related to how well their surgery works down the road?",
            "\u201cBiomedical research is changing from a discipline that was once exclusively reliant on experiments in a lab done on a bench with animal models or biological samples to a discipline that involves heavy and fast computational tools,\u201d says the Accelerator\u2019s executive lead and Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Chief Resource Information Officer Lara Jehi, MD.\n\u201cThat shift has happened because the data we now have at our disposal is way more than what we had even just 10 years ago,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe can now measure in detail the genetic composition of every single cell in the human body.

If we took our understanding of how the human body worked just 10 years ago and compared it to our understanding of how it works today with our new AI measurement tools, Dr. Jehi says that we\u2019d have a completely different outlook on how the human body works.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe advances in AI would be like taking a fuzzy black and white picture from the 1800s and comparing it to one from an iPhone 14 Pro with high definition and color,\u201d she illustrates. \u201cThis is the difference with the scale and the resolution of the data that we have to work with now.\u201d",

After reviewing those photos, the program tries to guess which ones are bone fractures. When it gets some of those answers wrong, you give it the correct answers. Then, you feed it another series of X-rays and have it rerun the program again with that new knowledge. Over time, the program gets better at identifying what\u2019s a bone fracture and what\u2019s not. Each time this process occurs, it\u2019s able to make those decisions faster, more efficiently and more effectively.\nAdvertisement\nNow, imagine that same process, but with hundreds or thousands of other datasets and other conditions. You can probably see how AI can help pinpoint and identify findings with the help of a radiologist\u2019s expertise.\n\u201cIt works like a second pair of eyes, like a shoulder-to-shoulder partner,\u201d says Dr. Chen. \u201cThe combined team of human plus AI is when you get the best performance.\u201d",
            "That\u2019s especially important when you consider that earlier detection is crucial to helping identify cancers at the lowest possible stage, especially for aggressive molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Earlier detection may also help decrease the rate of interval cancers, or those that develop between mammogram screenings.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really beneficial to look at how AI is helping in the so-called near-miss cases. These are findings that are really hard to see for even a very experienced radiologist,\u201d he continues. \u201cIn general, radiologists should be calling back less with the help of AI. And that\u2019s the point: AI helps us tease out which cases are truly negative and which cases are truly suspicious and need to come back for further testing.\u201d\nImproving access to patient care can be critical, especially for emergencies. While we continue to work against bias in healthcare, AI is being used to triage medical cases by bumping those considered most critical to the top of the care chain.",
            "\u201cWe do it on a disease-by-disease case,\u201d says Dr. Chen. \u201cWe identify diseases that need to be caught as early as possible and then we develop or bring in technology to do that. One instance we\u2019re doing that is with stroke.\u201d\nTime is brain tissue \u2014 so every minute counts when someone is having a stroke.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all or nothing. It\u2019s a process that happens over time,\u201d explains Dr. Chen. \u201cThe problem is that that timeframe is measured in minutes. Every minute that a patient doesn\u2019t receive care or doesn\u2019t receive intervention, a little bit more of their brain becomes irreversibly damaged.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s especially true when you have what\u2019s called a large vessel occlusion, a kind of ischemic stroke that occurs when a major artery in the brain is blocked. That kind of stroke is treatable if it\u2019s discovered in the right amount of time.",

Well, depending on the area of focus, medical specialty and what\u2019s needed, AI can be used in a variety of ways to impact and improve patient outcomes.\nBroken bones, breast cancer, brain bleeds \u2014 these conditions and many others, no matter how complex, need the right kind of tools to make a diagnosis. And often, a patient\u2019s journey depends on receiving the right diagnosis.\n\u201cIn radiology, technology and computers are used every day by doctors to identify diseases before anyone else,\u201d shares diagnostic radiologist Po-Hao Chen, MD. \u201cIn many cases, a radiologist is the first one to call the disease when it happens.\u201d\nBut how does AI fit into diagnostic testing? Well, let\u2019s revisit the definition of machine learning.",
            "\u201cA lot of cancers are really, really subtle. They can be really hard to see, depending on the patient\u2019s breast tissue, the type of breast cancer, how the tissue is evolving and how the cancer is developing,\u201d Dr. Dean notes. \u201cIf every breast cancer were one of those obvious textbook spiculated masses with calcifications, it would make my job a lot easier. But as our technology continues to improve, many of the cancers we\u2019re seeing now are really, really subtle. Those subtle cancers are the areas where I think AI has shown a lot of promise.\u201d",
            "To that end, Cleveland Clinic has become a founding member of a global effort to create an AI Alliance \u2014 an international community of researchers, developers and organizational leaders all working together to develop, achieve and advance the safe and responsible use of AI. The AI Alliance, started by IBM and Meta, now includes over 90 leading AI technology and research organizations to support and accelerate open, safe and trusted generative AI research and development. Cleveland Clinic will lead the effort to accelerate and enhance the ethical use of AI in medical research and patient care.\nAn example of Cleveland Clinic\u2019s commitment to AI innovation is the Discovery Accelerator, a 10-year strategic partnership between IBM and Cleveland Clinic, focused on accelerating biomedical discovery.",
            "\u201cWe are actively looking at and trying to deploy a solution that can do the detection and measurement of these nodules in the lung automatically,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat would help with the consistency and reproducibility of those measurements now with different kinds of cancer.\u201d\nLike the scheduling software, AI is being utilized in small and large ways to free up physicians\u2019 time behind the scenes and to help increase patients\u2019 access to care. In his 2024 State of the Clinic address, Cleveland Clinic\u2019s CEO and President Tom Mihaljevic, MD, highlighted several practical areas AI is already being used both in and out of the exam room. Among them:\nBroadly speaking, AI can also be beneficial when it comes to virtual appointments. Studies show that AI monitoring tools have been beneficial when it comes to seeing if patients are using medications like inhalers or insulin pens the way they\u2019re prescribed and providing much-needed guidance when questions arise.",
            "Already, healthcare providers, surgeons and researchers are using AI to develop new drugs and treatments, diagnose complex conditions more efficiently and improve patients\u2019 access to critical care \u2014 and this is only the beginning.\nOur experts share how AI is being used in healthcare systems right now and what we can expect down the line as the innovation and experimentation continues.\nArtificial intelligence describes the use of computers to do certain jobs that once required human intelligence. Examples include recognizing speech, making decisions and translating between different languages.\nMachine learning is a branch of AI that focuses on computer programming. It uses extremely large datasets and algorithms to learn how to do complex tasks and solve problems similar to the way a human would.",
            "A patient\u2019s journey often doesn\u2019t begin and end with diagnosis and treatment. Often, the journey involves watching, waiting and revisiting a diagnosis. For example, in the case of lung cancer, it\u2019s common for oncologists to begin tracking the growth of nodules before they\u2019re proven to be cancerous.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of doing screening programs,\u201d says Dr. Chen. \u201cThe ones that grow are more likely to be cancer. The ones that don\u2019t grow are more likely to be benign. That\u2019s why they\u2019re important to track over time. And most of that work is done manually by trained radiologists who go through every nodule that they can see in the lung. They track it, measure it and report on it.\u201d\nThat kind of work can be tedious and time-consuming. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a focus area for using AI.",
            "\u201cAI is no longer just an interesting idea, but it\u2019s being used in a real-life setting,\u201d says Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Chief Digital Officer Rohit Chandra, PhD. \u201cToday, there\u2019s a decent chance a computer can read an MRI or an X-ray better than a human, so it\u2019s relatively advanced in those use-cases. But then at the other extreme, you\u2019ve got generative AI like ChatGPT and all sorts of cool stuff you hear about in the media that\u2019s fascinating technology, but less mature. The potential for it is there and it\u2019s also quite promising.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe first step is identifying the finding, and then, using all of my expertise and my diagnostic criteria to determine if it\u2019s a real finding,\u201d explains Dr. Dean. \u201cIf it\u2019s something that I think looks suspicious, then it warrants diagnostic imaging. We bring the patient back, do additional diagnostic views and try to see if that finding is reproducible \u2014 can we still see it? Where is it in the breast? And then, we have other tools such as targeted ultrasound where we would home in right on that area and see if there is a mass there, what the breast tissue looks like and then do a biopsy if needed.\u201d\nOne benefit of AI programs is that they can function like a second set of eyes or a second reader. It improves the overall accuracy of the radiologist by decreasing callback rates and increasing specificity.\n\u201cWe are seeing that the AI can guide the radiologist to work up a finding they might not have otherwise seen,\u201d she says.",
            "The future of AI in healthcare, notes Dr. Jehi, is perhaps brightest in the realm of research.\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned throughout this process that there is a lot more to be learned by using AI,\u201d she says.\nAs an epilepsy specialist, Dr. Jehi researches how machine learning has changed epilepsy surgery as we know it.\nTraditionally, if a patient with epilepsy continues to have seizures and isn\u2019t responding to medication treatment, surgery becomes the next best option. As part of the surgical procedure, a surgeon would find the spot in the brain that\u2019s triggering the seizures, make sure that spot isn\u2019t critical for their functioning and then safely remove it.",
            "When used together, AI and machine learning can help us be more efficient and effective than ever before. These tools are being used with thousands of datasets to improve our ability to research various diseases and treatment options. These tools are also used behind the scenes, even before patients arrive onsite for care, to improve the patient experience.\nFrom radiology to neurology, emergency response services, administrative services and beyond, AI is changing the way we take care of ourselves and each other. In many ways, these innovations are forcing us to confront age-old questions: How can we continue to push ourselves to be better at what we already do well? And what\u2019s left to learn as we embrace groundbreaking technology?\nAdvertisement",
            "\u201cWe\u2019ve been completely overlooking how nature works,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil now, we haven\u2019t really analyzed how the genetic makeup of individuals factors into all of this. With my research, we have a lot of evidence that makes us believe that genetic makeup is actually quite important in driving surgical outcomes.\u201d\nWith AI and machine learning, Dr. Jehi hopes to continue pushing this research to the next level by looking at increasingly larger groups of patients.\nAs we continue to improve our understanding of AI and further our pursuit of innovation and discovery, it\u2019s up to healthcare providers around the world to question how best to utilize the tools at their disposal. Already, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued additional guidelines for safe and ethical AI use in the healthcare space \u2014 a continued effort that builds off their original 2021 guidelines but with added caution around large language models like ChatGPT and Bard.",
            "Taking care of yourself extends beyond symptom management and includes things like passion projects and meaningful moments\nSupport groups, financial assistance and survivorship programs are all readily available\nIt depends on factors like the stage of the cancer, your age and other risks\nReceiving this diagnosis can be scary, but there are ways to manage symptoms and reduce stress\nEating well can help support your immune system and maintain strength\nStrokes in the left side of the brain are more common and the effects are typically more noticeable\nStay hydrated, opt for fruits, veggies, whole grains and lean protein \u2014 and try to eat snacks and smaller meals throughout your day instead of larger portions\nNot all ear infections need antibiotics \u2014 cold and warm compresses and changing up your sleep position can help\nA glass of lemon water in the morning can help with digestion and boost vitamin C levels, and may even help get you into a better routine",
            "\u201cThe way we used to make those decisions, we\u2019d do a bunch of tests, we\u2019d measure brainwaves, we\u2019d take a picture of the brain, we\u2019d look at how the radiologist or the EEG doctor interpreted the results, and then, we\u2019d take the test results,\u201d she shares. \u201cBased on our own human experience, we\u2019d decide if we want to do the surgery or not. But we were very limited in our ability to build collective knowledge.\u201d\nIn essence, Dr. Jehi explains that doctors were stuck in a vacuum. They knew the expertise they\u2019d gained over the years had been valuable on an individual level, but without looking at the bigger picture, it was hard to tell who would respond best to which surgical technique if they were coming in as a first-time patient.",
            "The radiologists of the future will have a very different skill set compared to radiologists who excel today, notes Dr. Chen. And that future skill set will involve a significant portion of AI know-how.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago when almost all radiology was done on physical film that you held in your hand,\u201d he adds. \u201cAs radiology became computerized, doctors had to enhance their skill set. AI is changing digital radiology the same way digital radiology changed film.\u201d\nBreast cancer radiology has shown promising results using AI, according to breast cancer radiologist Laura Dean, MD.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s breast tissue is like their fingerprint or their handprint,\u201d she clarifies. \u201cIn other words, breast cancer can look very different from one patient to another. So, what we look for are very subtle changes in the appearance of the patient\u2019s own breast pattern. This is where we are really seeing an advantage of using AI in our interpretations.\u201d\nAdvertisement",
