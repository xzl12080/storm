AI could therefore be a means to enter an era of more effective medicine, improving care and reducing costs, while increasing patient safety.

Most were speaking about \u201cAI\u201d as if they were speaking of an independent entity rather than a set of various technological applications (tools), thus contributing to the perpetuation of the myth.

AI and big data must be integrated and used in an ethical manner if we want to develop AI tools that are going to be satisfactory for all actors. Thus, in the coming years, society will have to be vigilant concerning the place given to big data and AI.

Deskilling is the loss of competence of the human who does not know how to carry out a task that he did before because he stopped performing it for the benefit of the machine.

Kaminski (2019) discusses the GDPR's \u201cright to explanation,\u201d which aims to provide transparency in AI decision-making. However, the practical implementation of this right has been contentious, with debates on its scope and enforceability (Kaminski, 2019). In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)4 represents a step toward greater data transparency and consumer control by requiring businesses to disclose the categories of personal information they collect and the purposes for which they use this information (de la Torre, 2018).", "However, purely technical approaches to algorithmic fairness are inherently limited, as fairness is a highly contextual and contested concept that requires grappling with complex social, political, and ethical choices (Fazelpour and Lipton, 2020). Algorithmic bias often arises when AI systems optimize for a single metric like predictive accuracy while ignoring other contextual goals and values. As such, governing AI bias requires proactively engaging affected communities to understand their lived experiences and working toward AI systems that affirmatively further equity goals (Young et al., 2019b). It necessitates rethinking conventional non-discrimination frameworks to account for the systemic and intersectional impacts of AI (Hoffmann, 2019). Proposals include adapting disparate impact doctrine to cover unintended outcomes arising from AI systems and extending non-discrimination protections to cover AI-generated proxies for protected characteristics (Hellman, 2020).", "Other views, such as those from Miller (2019), suggest that complete transparency may not always be desirable or necessary. Miller argues that too much transparency can overwhelm users with information, leading to confusion rather than clarity. He proposes that transparency should be context-dependent, tailored to the needs of different stakeholders, and focused on providing actionable insights rather than exhaustive details (Miller, 2019). Reconciling these views requires a balance between sufficient transparency to build trust and ensure accountability without overloading users with excessive details. For example, adopting tiered transparency approaches can provide high-level overviews to general users while offering detailed explanations to experts.", "4 Ethical and societal considerations\n4.1 Ethical frameworks and principles\nEthical frameworks and principles provide guidance for the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems has proposed principles for ethical AI, including transparency, accountability, and promoting human wellbeing. These principles serve as a foundation for developing AI systems that align with societal values and ethical standards (IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous Intelligent Systems, 2019). Ensuring fairness and equity in AI systems is also a central ethical concern. Mehrabi et al. (2021) emphasize the importance of fairness and propose methods to detect and mitigate biases in AI systems, helping to prevent discrimination and promote inclusivity (Mehrabi et al., 2021).", "Beyond liability allocation, the complexity and opacity of AI systems also pose challenges for causation and harm assessment in product liability cases. Plaintiffs face difficulties in obtaining evidence to prove an AI system caused their alleged injuries, as the inner workings of AI systems are often protected as trade secrets and may not be accessible through conventional discovery processes (Wexler, 2018). Apportionment of damages is also complicated by the potential for AI systems to cause diffuse harms that are individually small but cumulatively significant, such as minor inconveniences or negative externalities (Selbst and Barocas, 2018)", "The rapid advancement and deployment of AI systems in various domains, such as healthcare (Luxton, 2016; Topol, 2019), education (Chassignol et al., 2018; Holmes et al., 2019; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019), employment (Kim, 2017; Manyika et al., 2017; Tambe et al., 2019), and criminal justice, have raised pressing questions about their impact on individual and societal wellbeing. As AI algorithms become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous, their decision-making processes can become opaque, making it difficult for individuals to understand how these systems are shaping their lives. This lack of transparency, coupled with the potential for AI systems to perpetuate biases, cause unintended harm, and infringe upon human rights, has led to calls for greater accountability in AI governance."], "title": "Transparency and accountability in AI systems: safeguarding wellbeing ...", "meta": {"query": "accountability and transparency of AI in healthcare"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, "https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/how-to-prevent-algorithmic-bias-in-health-care/": {"url": "https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/how-to-prevent-algorithmic-bias-in-health-care/", "description": "What Can Data Science Teams Do to Prevent and Mitigate Algorithmic Bias in Health Care?
