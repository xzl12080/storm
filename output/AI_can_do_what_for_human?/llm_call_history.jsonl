According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), while AI has the potential to significantly enhance healthcare delivery globally, it also carries the risk of misuse and harm if ethical considerations are neglected. This sentiment is echoed in a narrative review that highlights the ethical and regulatory challenges inherent in the deployment of AI technologies in healthcare settings (PMID: 38384518).\n\nAnother major concern is data privacy and security. AI systems often require access to vast amounts of sensitive patient data to function effectively, raising questions about who has access to this data and how it is protected. Ensuring the confidentiality of patient information while utilizing AI tools is crucial to maintaining trust in healthcare systems.\n\nIn addition to privacy issues, there are concerns regarding bias in AI algorithms. If the data used to train AI systems is not representative of the diverse patient population, the resulting algorithms may produce biased outcomes, adversely affecting certain groups of patients. This issue underscores the need for inclusive data sets that reflect the diversity of populations served.\n\nIn the education sector, similar ethical concerns emerge. The deployment of AI tools in educational settings can lead to the personalization of learning experiences; however, it can also lead to privacy concerns related to student data. The collection and analysis of student performance data can infringe on privacy rights if not managed correctly.\n\nFurthermore, there is the risk of exacerbating existing inequalities. Students from marginalized backgrounds may not have the same access to AI-driven educational tools as their more affluent peers, potentially widening the educational gap. It is essential for policymakers to consider how to ensure equitable access to AI resources in education.\n\nIn summary, while AI has significant potential to enhance both healthcare and education, it is critical to address the ethical concerns surrounding its use, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and equitable access.

AI utilizes algorithms to assess data from the world, make a representation of that data, and use that information to make an inference. From handling administrative tasks to actively diagnosing disease, AI could make treatment faster and more effective in clinical settings, especially as technology continues to improve.\nHowever, AI can suffer from bias, which has striking implications for health care. The term \u201calgorithmic bias\u201d speaks to this problem. It was first defined by the co-directors of the AI for Health Care: Concepts and Applications and Innovation with AI in Health Care programs at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health: Trishan Panch, primary care physician, president-elect of the HSPH Alumni Association, and co-founder of digital health company Wellframe, and Heather Mattie, lecturer of biostatistics and co-director of the health data science master\u2019s program.\n[2]: An old adage in the computing world has become a principle in the development of machine learning models: \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d In other words, the quality of your output depends on the quality of your input.\nA new Yale study finds that this same principle applies to medical artificial intelligence, where the threat of bias can compromise clinical decision making.\n\u201cBias in; bias out,\u201d said John Onofrey, an assistant professor of radiology & biomedical imaging and of urology at Yale School of Medicine. \u201cThe same idea absolutely applies.\u201d\nWriting in the journal, PLOS Digital Health, Onofrey and his team identified medical AI bias in scientific literature by looking for instances, factors, or prejudice that affected the outcome of AI algorithms. They also provided practical steps to combat it.\nThe study is among the first to focus on the implications and consequences of biased AI in health care.\n\nNow give your response.

The principle of \"garbage in, garbage out\" highlights that the output quality is directly linked to the input quality. Therefore, using diverse and representative datasets is essential to minimize bias. This involves curating data that adequately reflects different demographics, socioeconomic statuses, and health conditions, which can help prevent skewed results that may arise from underrepresentation of certain groups.\n\nSecond, continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI algorithms are necessary. Regularly auditing AI systems for biases can help identify any disparities in their performance across different patient groups. Research from Yale emphasizes the importance of examining the factors and prejudices that may impact AI algorithm outcomes, reinforcing the need for systematic checks to identify and correct biases as they arise.\n\nThird, involving interdisciplinary teams in the development and implementation of AI systems can significantly reduce biases. Including diverse perspectives\u2014such as those from clinicians, data scientists, ethicists, and representatives of affected communities\u2014can foster a more comprehensive understanding of potential biases and lead to the development of more equitable AI solutions.\n\nAdditionally, establishing guidelines and best practices for ethical AI use in healthcare is vital. Regulatory frameworks can provide standards for transparency in AI systems, allowing stakeholders to understand how decisions are made and ensuring accountability in cases where biases are detected.\n\nFinally, fostering awareness and education around algorithmic bias among healthcare professionals and AI developers is essential. Training programs that address the implications of bias in AI can empower practitioners to recognize and address biases in clinical settings, promoting better decision-making and patient outcomes.\n\nImplementing these measures can help create more equitable and effective AI systems in healthcare, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes while minimizing the risk of algorithmic bias.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1732347662, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 368, "prompt_tokens": 569, "total_tokens": 937, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

The term is now regularly appended to all manner of tools and technologies, even when it\u2019s unclear exactly what role AI plays in delivering desired outcomes.\nGiven the rapid evolution of intelligent services, this scenario isn\u2019t surprising \u2014 like cloud, mobile, and other digital frameworks before it, AI eventually will find its niche. One area that showed early promise and has largely lived up to the hype is customer service. Eighty percent of customers now expect AI to improve customer service, and 43 percent of financial service firms are already using AI to personalize the customer experience.\nHere's how AI is shaping the current state of customer service in the financial industry, and what firms can do to make the most of smart solutions.\nRELATED: AI drives real business results for financial institutions.\nFour Use Cases for AI in Financial Customer Service\n[3]: How to engage customers\u2014and keep them engaged\u2014is a focal question for organizations across the business-to-consumer (B2C) landscape, where disintermediation by digital platforms continues to erode traditional business models. Engaged customers are more loyal, have more touchpoints with their chosen brands, and deliver greater value over their lifetime.\nYet financial institutions have often struggled to secure the deep consumer engagement typical in other mobile app\u2013intermediated services. The average visit to a bank app lasts only half as long as a visit to an online shopping app, and only one-quarter as long as a visit to a gaming app. Hence, customer service offers one of the few opportunities available to transform financial-services interactions into memorable and long-lasting engagements.\n[4]: Generative AI (gen AI) is revolutionizing the banking industry as financial institutions use the technology to supercharge customer-facing chatbots, prevent fraud, and speed up time-consuming tasks such as developing code, preparing drafts of pitch books, and summarizing regulatory reports.\n[5]: Published: 1 May 2024\nContributors: Keith O'Brien, Amanda Downie\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly important technology for the banking sector. When used as a tool to power internal operations and customer-facing applications, it can help banks improve customer service, fraud detection and money and investment management.\nTo stay ahead of technology trends, increase their competitive advantage, and provide valuable services and better customer experiences, financial services firms like banks have embraced digital transformation initiatives.\nThe advent of AI technologies has made digital transformation even more important, as it has the potential to remake the industry and determine which companies thrive.\nSchedule time today with one of our product specialists to get a custom tour of IBM watsonx Assistant.\nSign up for the IBM newsletter\n[6]: Published: 8 December 2023\nContributors: Matthew Finio, Amanda Downie\nArtificial intelligence (AI) in finance is the use of technology, including advanced algorithms and machine learning (ML), to analyze data, automate tasks and improve decision-making in the financial services industry.\nArtificial intelligence in finance refers to the application of a set of technologies, particularly machine learning algorithms, in the finance industry.

A qualitative survey study conducted among French health professionals highlights that while there is optimism regarding AI's potential to revolutionize patient care, significant concerns remain about its implementation in daily practice.\n\nOne primary concern among healthcare professionals is accountability. Many practitioners worry about who is responsible when AI systems make errors or when clinical decisions derived from AI recommendations lead to adverse patient outcomes. This raises questions about the extent to which AI can be held accountable and how liability is assigned in such scenarios. The fear of losing the human touch in healthcare, as well as the potential for AI to make decisions without human oversight, contributes to these concerns.\n\nTransparency is another critical ethical consideration. Healthcare professionals often express the need for clarity about how AI algorithms make decisions. There is a prevailing sentiment that AI systems should be interpretable, allowing practitioners to understand the rationale behind AI-generated recommendations. This transparency is essential for building trust between healthcare providers, patients, and the AI technologies being employed.\n\nThe study, which included interviews with 40 stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, indicates that these ethical considerations significantly affect the acceptance and integration of AI in healthcare settings. Participants voiced a desire for frameworks that ensure ethical use, safeguard patient welfare, and maintain professional accountability. The findings suggest that without addressing these concerns, the potential of AI to enhance patient care may be hindered by skepticism and reluctance among healthcare professionals.\n\nOverall, while AI holds the promise of improving efficiency and outcomes in healthcare, professionals call for careful consideration of ethical issues surrounding accountability and transparency to ensure that AI is integrated in a manner that prioritizes patient safety and professional integrity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1732347674, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_0705bf87c0", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 472, "total_tokens": 813, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

Health care professionals can benefit from lower operational costs through improved decision-making and automated services. This technology allows providers to design customized treatment plans and diagnose conditions more accurately and quickly than traditional methods allow, leading to enhanced patient safety and lower overall costs for services[1][2]. \n\nPhysicians have shown a positive outlook towards AI tools, recognizing their capacity to save time and improve monitoring of health populations. Many healthcare professionals believe that AI could lead to a new era of more effective medicine, addressing issues such as medical deserts and management difficulties within healthcare systems[2]. For instance, an AI system demonstrated exceptional accuracy in detecting lung nodules, outperforming human radiologists with a diagnostic accuracy rate of 94%[6]. As AI continues to evolve, roles such as health informatics specialists and AI engineers are becoming increasingly prevalent, reflecting the growing integration of AI within the health sector[1].\n\n## Benefits in Finance\n\nIn the financial sector, AI technologies are transforming customer experiences by facilitating personalized interactions and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The integration of AI in financial services is perceived as a competitive advantage, with over 81% of C-suite professionals recognizing its significance for future success[4]. Companies that have adopted AI solutions have reported substantial revenue increases, with many financial institutions noting an uptick of more than 20% in revenue attributed to AI implementation[4].\n\nAI also enhances decision-making processes by providing organizations with comprehensive analyses based on large datasets, allowing for improved strategic planning and execution[8]. For instance, predictive analytics enables financial institutions to forecast demand trends and adjust operations accordingly, thereby minimizing costs associated with excess inventory[8]. However, integrating AI into finance presents regulatory and compliance challenges that require careful navigation to mitigate societal and environmental impacts[9].\n\nOverall, AI serves as a catalyst for efficiency, accuracy, and enhanced service delivery across various fields, showcasing its transformative potential in both health care and finance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1732347726, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3de1288069", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 443, "prompt_tokens": 2116, "total_tokens": 2559, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "raw_kwargs": {}}

Developing precise legal definitions and guidelines for transparency and accountability, particularly regarding the \u201cright to explanation\u201d under GDPR and similar provisions in other jurisdictions, is essential (Edwards and Veale, 2017; Kaminski, 2019). Balancing competing interests through legal reforms that allow for transparency without compromising intellectual property, such as confidentiality agreements and standardized reporting, is another key strategy (Ananny and Crawford, 2018; Wexler, 2018). Implementing targeted anti-discrimination regulations that address the unique challenges posed by AI systems is also crucial. This can include bias audits, transparency reports, and redress mechanisms (Calo, 2017; Kim, 2017; Reisman et al., 2018)\nBig data analytics and machine learning that underpin AI systems are often in tension with these core data protection principles (Chesterman, 2022). AI thrives on large, diverse datasets and finds value in data reuse for initially unspecified purposes. AI systems often rely on inferential analytics to derive sensitive insights about individuals from non-sensitive data (Wachter and Mittelstadt, 2019). The opacity of \u201cblack-box\u201d machine learning models conflicts with data protection law's emphasis on transparency, interpretability and individual rights (Edwards and Veale, 2017).\nTransparency and accountability are widely recognized as essential principles for responsible AI development and deployment. Transparency enables individuals to understand how AI systems make decisions that affect their lives, while accountability ensures that there are clear mechanisms for assigning responsibility and providing redress when these systems cause harm (Novelli et al., 2023). However, implementing these principles in practice is challenging, as they often conflict with other important considerations, such as privacy, intellectual property, and the complexity of AI systems.\n. By anchoring the discourse on these core ethical principles, this review provides a strong normative foundation for the recommendations and emphasize their importance in promoting human wellbeing.\nFor the purposes of this review, AI is defined as the development and use of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making (Chassignol et al., 2018). Wellbeing, in the context of AI governance, refers to the overall quality of life and flourishing of individuals and society, encompassing aspects such as physical and mental health, safety, privacy, autonomy, fairness, and social cohesion (Floridi et al., 2018; IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous Intelligent Systems, 2019). By focusing on the intersection of AI and wellbeing, this review aims to emphasize the importance of considering the broader societal impacts of AI technologies beyond their technical capabilities.\nData protection and privacy laws are crucial for enhancing transparency and accountability in AI systems. Kaminski (2019) discusses the GDPR's \u201cright to explanation,\u201d which aims to provide transparency in AI decision-making. However, the practical implementation of this right has been contentious, with debates on its scope and enforceability (Kaminski, 2019). In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)4 represents a step toward greater data transparency and consumer control by requiring businesses to disclose the categories of personal information they collect and the purposes for which they use this information (de la Torre, 2018).\nHowever, purely technical approaches to algorithmic fairness are inherently limited, as fairness is a highly contextual and contested concept that requires grappling with complex social, political, and ethical choices (Fazelpour and Lipton, 2020). Algorithmic bias often arises when AI systems optimize for a single metric like predictive accuracy while ignoring other contextual goals and values. As such, governing AI bias requires proactively engaging affected communities to understand their lived experiences and working toward AI systems that affirmatively further equity goals (Young et al., 2019b). It necessitates rethinking conventional non-discrimination frameworks to account for the systemic and intersectional impacts of AI (Hoffmann, 2019). Proposals include adapting disparate impact doctrine to cover unintended outcomes arising from AI systems and extending non-discrimination protections to cover AI-generated proxies for protected characteristics (Hellman, 2020).\nOther views, such as those from Miller (2019), suggest that complete transparency may not always be desirable or necessary. Miller argues that too much transparency can overwhelm users with information, leading to confusion rather than clarity. He proposes that transparency should be context-dependent, tailored to the needs of different stakeholders, and focused on providing actionable insights rather than exhaustive details (Miller, 2019). Reconciling these views requires a balance between sufficient transparency to build trust and ensure accountability without overloading users with excessive details. For example, adopting tiered transparency approaches can provide high-level overviews to general users while offering detailed explanations to experts.\n4 Ethical and societal considerations\n4.1 Ethical frameworks and principles\nEthical frameworks and principles provide guidance for the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems has proposed principles for ethical AI, including transparency, accountability, and promoting human wellbeing. These principles serve as a foundation for developing AI systems that align with societal values and ethical standards (IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous Intelligent Systems, 2019). Ensuring fairness and equity in AI systems is also a central ethical concern. Mehrabi et al. (2021) emphasize the importance of fairness and propose methods to detect and mitigate biases in AI systems, helping to prevent discrimination and promote inclusivity (Mehrabi et al., 2021).\nBeyond liability allocation, the complexity and opacity of AI systems also pose challenges for causation and harm assessment in product liability cases. Plaintiffs face difficulties in obtaining evidence to prove an AI system caused their alleged injuries, as the inner workings of AI systems are often protected as trade secrets and may not be accessible through conventional discovery processes (Wexler, 2018). Apportionment of damages is also complicated by the potential for AI systems to cause diffuse harms that are individually small but cumulatively significant, such as minor inconveniences or negative externalities (Selbst and Barocas, 2018)\n[3]\n- Risk. The financial institution should determine who defines risk guardrails (such as those related to data privacy and intellectual property infringement) and mitigation strategies. It should also decide to what extent existing frameworks should be adjusted to account for risks specific to gen AI, including whether additional governance is required for particular use cases (such as customer-facing ones).\n- Change management. A committee will need to lead the execution of a change management plan to ensure evolutions in mindsets and behaviors as required for the successful adoption of gen AI across the enterprise.\n[4]\nEthical values are driving physicians and individuals without conflict of interest\nOnly one person, a researcher working in the aeronautics field, spoke about the human\u2013computer interaction (HCI). For him, even though HCI is not specific to AI, questioning the automation of tasks and limits should be considered as one of the main goals of the integration of AI into healthcare tools. He explained that, in this discipline, one of the main ideas is to delegate only when necessary. If not, there is a risk of deskilling. Deskilling is the loss of competence of the human who does not know how to carry out a task that he did before because he stopped performing it for the benefit of the machine. Thus, the research said that before integrating AI into medical practice, it would be important to ask ourselves what can be transferred, to identify repetitive tasks that AI can do without risking the loss of skills by the physicians\n[5]\nIn their 2019 paper in Journal of Global Health \u201cArtificial intelligence and algorithmic bias: implications for health systems,\u201d Panch, Mattie, and Rifat Atun define algorithmic bias as the application of an algorithm that compounds existing inequities in socioeconomic status, race, ethnic background, religion, gender, disability, or sexual orientation and amplifies inequities in health systems.\nIn other words, algorithms in health care technology don\u2019t simply reflect back social inequities but may ultimately exacerbate them. What does this mean in practice, how does it manifest, and how can it be counteracted?\nHow Does Algorithmic Bias in Health Care Happen \u2014 and Why Is It so Damaging to Patients?\n\u201cBias can creep into the process anywhere in creating algorithms: from the very beginning with study design and data collection, data entry and cleaning, algorithm and model choice, and implementation and dissemination of the results.\u201d\nWhat Can Minimize Large-Scale Algorithmic Bias and Effectively Harness the Power of AI?\nToday, more health professionals are at least aware of algorithmic bias. Many companies are also taking proactive steps to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in their teams. \u201cWithout this\n\nThe topic of the page: AI can do what for human?\n\nThe section you need to write: Challenges and Risks\n\nWrite the section with proper inline citations (Start your writing with # section title.

These challenges are multifaceted, encompassing ethical, legal, operational, and social dimensions.\n\n## Ethical and Societal Concerns\n\nThe integration of AI into various sectors raises significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding algorithmic bias and fairness. Algorithmic bias occurs when AI systems amplify existing social inequities related to socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, gender, and other characteristics, thereby exacerbating disparities in areas like healthcare and employment[5]. To mitigate these biases, it is essential to engage affected communities in the design and implementation of AI systems, ensuring that their lived experiences inform the development process[4][5]. Ethical frameworks, such as those proposed by the IEEE Global Initiative, emphasize transparency, accountability, and the promotion of human wellbeing as guiding principles for AI governance[2].\n\n## Transparency and Accountability\n\nTransparency and accountability are critical yet challenging aspects of AI deployment. While transparency allows individuals to understand how AI systems make decisions affecting their lives, achieving it in practice is complex due to the \"black-box\" nature of many machine learning models, which conflicts with data protection laws that prioritize interpretability and individual rights[2]. Furthermore, the \u201cright to explanation\u201d under the GDPR aims to enhance transparency, but its practical application remains contentious and raises questions about enforceability and scope[2]. Striking a balance between sufficient transparency to build trust and ensuring the protection of proprietary information is vital for responsible AI usage.\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\nThe financial sector, in particular, must determine appropriate risk mitigation strategies, defining risk guardrails concerning data privacy and intellectual property infringement[3]. As organizations adopt AI technologies, they face the challenge of implementing change management plans that facilitate the transition to generative AI across their operations. This requires shifts in mindsets and behaviors to ensure that AI adoption is effective and beneficial[3].\n\n## Data Protection and Privacy\n\nData protection laws are paramount in enhancing transparency and accountability within AI systems. Legislation such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides a framework for greater consumer control over personal information, highlighting the need for businesses to disclose data practices clearly[2]. However, the tension between big data analytics and core data protection principles complicates the landscape, as AI often relies on large, diverse datasets that may involve using sensitive information without explicit consent[2].\n\n## The Risk of Deskilling\n\nIn fields like healthcare, the integration of AI poses the risk of deskilling, where healthcare professionals may lose essential skills due to over-reliance on automated systems[4]. This concern emphasizes the need for careful consideration of which tasks should be delegated to AI, ensuring that professionals maintain their competencies to provide quality care.\n\nIn summary, addressing the challenges and risks associated with AI requires a holistic approach that considers ethical principles, legal frameworks, and the practical realities of technology deployment.

From optimizing traffic flow and enhancing safety to enabling fully autonomous vehicles, AI is shaping the future of how we move. The adoption of AI in transportation brings numerous benefits, such as reducing fuel consumption, minimizing traffic congestion, and improving operational efficiency.\n[4]\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the finance industry by enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making processes. As financial institutions face increasing pressure to innovate and adapt to rapidly changing market conditions, AI technologies have emerged as a critical tool for achieving operational excellence. From automating routine tasks to providing advanced analytics for risk management, AI is transforming how financial services operate.\n[5]\nArtificial intelligence has gone mainstream. The term is now regularly appended to all manner of tools and technologies, even when it\u2019s unclear exactly what role AI plays in delivering desired outcomes.\nGiven the rapid evolution of intelligent services, this scenario isn\u2019t surprising \u2014 like cloud, mobile, and other digital frameworks before it, AI eventually will find its niche. One area that showed early promise and has largely lived up to the hype is customer service. Eighty percent of customers now expect AI to improve customer service, and 43 percent of financial service firms are already using AI to personalize the customer experience.\nHere's how AI is shaping the current state of customer service in the financial industry, and what firms can do to make the most of smart solutions.\nRELATED: AI drives real business results for financial institutions.\nFour Use Cases for AI in Financial Customer Service\n[6]\nThe future of transportation is being shaped by AI, and its impact will be felt in every aspect of our travel experiences. By addressing the challenges and embracing the potential of AI, the transportation industry can usher in a new era of efficiency, safety, and sustainability.\nAI is set to enhance the future of transportation, transforming the industry in profound ways. With its ability to optimize efficiency, improve safety, and enhance the overall travel experience, AI is reshaping the transportation sector. From smarter planning and booking to the development of self-driving cars and shuttles, AI technologies hold the potential to unlock new levels of efficiency and sustainability in transportation.\nHowever, despite these challenges, the future of AI in transportation is promising. As technology continues to advance and society becomes more comfortable with AI, the transportation industry will be able to unlock new levels of efficiency, safety, and sustainability. The potential applications are vast, ranging from autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems to intelligent transportation networks. With responsible and strategic planning, AI in transportation can revolutionize the way we travel and reshape the entire transportation sector.\nThe future of AI in transportation holds immense potential for innovation and advancement. As technologies evolve, we can expect AI to drive significant progress in various areas, including:\n[7]\nLast, AI is in its infancy and its long-term implications are uncertain. Future applications of AI in healthcare delivery, in the approach to innovation and in how each of us thinks about our health, may be transformative. We can imagine a future in which population-level data from wearables and implants change our understanding of human biology and of how medicines work, enabling personalized and real-time treatment for all. This report focuses on what is real today and what will enable innovation and adoption tomorrow, rather than exploring the long-term future of personalized medicine. Faced with the uncertainty of the eventual scope of application of emerging technologies, some short-term opportunities are clear, as are steps that will enable health providers and systems to bring benefits from innovation in AI to the populations they serve more rapidly.\nAI in healthcare today\nMore data, better data, more connected data\n[8]\nThe rapid advancement and deployment of AI systems in various domains, such as healthcare (Luxton, 2016; Topol, 2019), education (Chassignol et al., 2018; Holmes et al., 2019; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019), employment (Kim, 2017; Manyika et al., 2017; Tambe et al., 2019), and criminal justice, have raised pressing questions about their impact on individual and societal wellbeing. As AI algorithms become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous, their decision-making processes can become opaque, making it difficult for individuals to understand how these systems are shaping their lives. This lack of transparency, coupled with the potential for AI systems to perpetuate biases, cause unintended harm, and infringe upon human rights, has led to calls for greater accountability in AI governance.\n[9]\nCombining big data and AI in healthcare could lead to an important breakthrough for both patients and professionals. However, although we identified many of the driving forces for the development of AI in healthcare, the above-mentioned obstacles could also hinder it, especially if the values of the stakeholders are not respected. AI and big data must be integrated and used in an ethical manner if we want to develop AI tools that are going to be satisfactory for all actors. Thus, in the coming years, society will have to be vigilant concerning the place given to big data and AI. Since AI continues to move forward, it is up to all actors involved to define the essential points for a fair form of healthcare consistent with their values as we identified in this work. Thus, we will have to \u201ccross the valley of death\u201d to ensure that everyone communicates and collaborates in a way that avoids missing any essential points\nFor most of the individuals interviewed, the perception of AI benefits, in part, from its representation in popular culture. There appears to a collective fascination with AI. Indeed, the frequently denied myth is still alive and with it the hope to achieve the perfect human being. Indeed, as many of the interviewees stated, it is very important to debunk this myth in people\u2019s minds to allow them to have a clearer insight about what it is. Most were speaking about \u201cAI\u201d as if they were speaking of an independent entity rather than a set of various technological applications (tools), thus contributing to the perpetuation of the myth. In addition, the interviews highlighted the fuzzy notion of AI. For example, there was confusion between \u201cweak AI\u201dFootnote 1 and \u201cstrong AI\u201d.Footnote 2\n\nThe topic of the page: AI can do what for human?\n\nThe section you need to write: Future of AI\n\nWrite the section with proper inline citations (Start your writing with # section title.
